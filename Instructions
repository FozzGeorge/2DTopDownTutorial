These files make up a Unity game file that I have created. The game is comprised of four different tutorials that are put together to make a single component.
The idea is that anyone can open Unity, follow these instructions and replicate the exact same game.
The tutorials are as follows:

1: 2D Top-Down Movement
2: Enemy Following AI
3: Enemy Shooting
4: Scoring System.

When you open the game, double click the Scenes folder and open the "SampleScene" option. When you press play, you'll be able to see all 
four of these tutorials brought to life. 
To play, simply use W,A,S,D to move the character, and collect the hexagons in order to score.

Enjoy!
